Hi, I'm RemiSpin, a second year CS student. I've been quite lazy on coding before college, but I'm trying to catch up with my peers. Trying my best.
If you read this, I am working on a personal website and a recreation of the first Pokemon game, Red and Blue, in a text-based format, in Java.
If you are willing to help a student with some tips, shoot me a message at SaladLillie on Discord.
Happy Hunting!
